# Sneaky Patch
## Description
A high-value system has been compromised. Security analysts have detected suspicious activity within the kernel, but the attackerâ€™s presence remains hidden. Traditional detection tools have failed, and the intruder has established deep persistence. Investigate a live system suspected of running a kernel-level backdoor.

It's provided a Machine to investigate
## Solution
From the description, we thought in starting searching in the kernel logs. Executing the command:
```bash
sudo dmesg
```
It was possible to watch some interesting things from the output:
```bash
[   26.371308] systemd-journald[132]: File /var/log/journal/dc7c8ac5c09a4bbfaf3d09d399f10d96/user-1000.journal corrupted or uncleanly shut down, renaming and replacing.
[   32.701060] spatch: loading out-of-tree module taints kernel.
[   32.701072] spatch: module verification failed: signature and/or required key missing - tainting kernel
[   32.702610] [CIPHER BACKDOOR] Module loaded. Write data to /proc/cipher_bd
[   32.704977] [CIPHER BACKDOOR] Executing command: id
[   32.711742] [CIPHER BACKDOOR] Command Output: uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

[   41.059522] traps: mate-power-mana[1887] trap int3 ip:71d3aec050df sp:7fff1aa8dd40 error:0 in libglib-2.0.so.0.8000.0[71d3aebc1000+a0000]
```
We can observe:
- Module 'spatch' loaded, it's out-of-tree & tainted, this proves that this module is not suppose to be in kernel.
- The backdoor exists ([CIPHER BACKDOOR]) and accepts commands though the /proc/cipher_bd archive.
Let's find where this 'spatch' is:
```bash
find / -type f -name 'spatch.ko' 2>/dev/null
```
Output:
```bash
/lib/modules/6.8.0-1016-aws/kernel/drivers/misc/spatch.ko
```
After getting the path we search inside the module:
```bash
strings /lib/modules/6.8.0-1016-aws/kernel/drivers/misc/spatch.ko | less
```
Output:
```bash
6[CIPHER BACKDOOR] Module loaded. Write data to /proc/%s
6[CIPHER BACKDOOR] Module unloaded.
3[CIPHER BACKDOOR] Failed to read output file
6[CIPHER BACKDOOR] Command Output: %s

PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
description=Cipher is always root
```
